title: What are Algorithms?
author: Oliver Pope

An algorithm is something every person does every single day, it is the
**procedure** or **formula** for solving a problem. For example, when an average
person wakes up they will take a shower, do their hair,  eat breakfast, drink
coffee, watch the news, get dressed, and go to work. You could specify this as a
person’s algorithm for getting ready for their day, it is simply the procedure
one goes through to solve one’s problem.

In mathematics, an algorithm can simply be a function, such as $f(x)= x^2$.
Where the procedure is finding where $y=0$ and that would be $x$. Such as this
equation would be 0, as shown below.

In computer science, an algorithm can be a lot harder to understand or
interpret, however it is mostly the same thing. If, for instance, I wanted to
know if 5 was greater than 1, I could use JavaScript to do it:

{% highlight javascript %}
// simple if statement 
if (5 > 1) {
    console.log('5 is greater than 1');
} else {
    // if 5>1 was an inequality, you could handle it with an else statement, however this is optional
    console.log('this will never happen');
}
{% endhighlight %}

Algorithms can get much more complicated and hardcore than these simple
examples, applications and programs are just elaborate algorithms that use
special things like an *if statement* to make magic happen. All it is is common
sense and logic, literally everyone does it.
