Tastes like consuming a bitter bucket of salt

Whispers I can hardly catch

Vision is billions
of trillions 
of specks
of diminutive flurries
of a mixture of compounds 
of an atom so massively minuscule

Touch withdraws me to a place where I could 

Sculpt gargantuan castles
Excavate a moat of alligators to protect castles
Rupture the surrounding sand-cities with effortless force

All day long and never need to grow up
